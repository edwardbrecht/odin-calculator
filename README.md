# odin-calculator
This is a simple calculator app.<br>
This is the last exercise in The Odin Project's Fundamentals curriculum.<br>
The app is written is HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br>
The calculator is functional and styled, but there are a few missing features:<br>
1. There is no button to flip the sign of an input.<br>
2. Pressing on the equals sign after a calculation does not repeat that calculation with the result of the last.<br>
3. No keyboard support.<br>
