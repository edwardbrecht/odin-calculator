# odin-calculator
This is a simple calculator app.
This is the last exercise in The Odin Project's Fundamentals curriculum.
The app is written is HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
The calculator is functional and styled, but there are a few missing features:
    1. There is no button to flip the sign of an input.
    2. Pressing on the equals sign after a calculation does not repeat that calculation with the result of the last.
    3. No keyboard support.
